### Ray Tracing in C
#### Stack Used - C, SDL2/SDL.h
##### Crude implementation of a simple 2D Ray Tracing engine in C
Ray tracing simulates the way light rays interact with objects in a scene.<br>
The GUI consists of a circular light source and an opaque object. The object does not allow the light from the source to pass through.<br>

The light source can be moved around to see how the light rays change.
<br> To use and test this code, <code>SDL2</code> is required. Check out my easy to follow [installation guide](https://github.com/51ddhesh/SDL2_Setup).
